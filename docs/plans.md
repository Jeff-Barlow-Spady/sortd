# Sortd Codebase Audit and Improvement Plan

### 1. High Priority - Foundation for Efficiency
- **Standardize Error Handling:**
  - Audit current error handling across all modules.
  - Develop a standard error handling library for consistent error logging and messaging.
  - Refactor existing code to utilize the standard library.
- **Complete Partially Implemented Methods:**
  - Identify all partially implemented methods (e.g., OrganizeDir).
  - Define clear specifications for these methods and complete their implementations with proper unit tests.
- **Structured Logging:**
  - Evaluate and select a structured logging framework (e.g., logrus, zap).
  - Integrate logging across modules for better debugging and performance analysis.
- **Git Workflow Setup:**
  - Define a branch strategy (e.g., feature branches, develop and main/master branches).
  - Create commit guidelines and enforce atomic and descriptive commits.
  - Develop and integrate pull request (PR) templates.

### 2. Medium Priority - Core Performance Improvements
- **Parallel Processing for File Operations:**
  - Review current file operations and identify sequential execution points.
  - Create a modular worker pool system using goroutines with controlled concurrency.
  - Ensure errors within goroutines propagate gracefully.
- **Batch Processing Capabilities:**
  - Implement batch processing logic to minimize filesystem access overhead.
- **Improve Collision Handling:**
  - Research and integrate more efficient algorithms for file collision handling and resolution.

### 3. Medium Priority - Analysis Engine Enhancement
- **Extend Content Type Detection:**
  - Go beyond MIME types to perform deeper content inspection.
- **Metadata Extraction as Pluggable Modules:**
  - Develop separate modules for metadata extraction for common file formats.
  - Define and document clean interfaces for integration.
- **Plugin Interfaces for Analysis:**
  - Design and document clean and extendable interfaces for future analysis plugins.

### 4. High Priority - Standout Feature: Smart Rule Learning
- **User Pattern Recognition:**
  - Develop a system to capture and analyze user file organization patterns.
- **Recommendation Engine:**
  - Design and implement a recommendation engine that suggests organization rules.
  - Create a feedback loop for users to accept or reject suggestions.
- **Modular Integration:**
  - Ensure that smart rule learning is implemented as a clearly separated module interfacing with the core system.

### 5. Lower Priority - Additional Optimizations
- **Performance Profiling:**
  - Profile the application to locate file processing bottlenecks.
- **FS Caching:**
  - Implement caching for frequently accessed filesystem information.
- **Optimize Watch Daemon:**
  - Enhance the efficiency of the watch daemon to lower resource usage during idle times.
- **Enhanced Testing Coverage:**
  - Increase unit testing coverage, especially for core functionalities.

### Additional Guidelines for All Changes
- **Modular Architecture & Documentation:**
  - Maintain clear separation of concerns across modules.
  - Document code thoroughly with comments and interface descriptions.
- **Test-Driven Development (TDD):**
  - Create unit tests for new modules and functionality before implementations.
- **Backward Compatibility:**
  - Ensure changes and new features maintain compatibility with existing configuration files.
- **Clean Git Workflow:**
  - Utilize atomic, well-described commits and follow the established branching strategy.
